TestCoreImage2
==============

Playing with Core Image, Core Filters and the like on iOS
So far I do not think there is anything interesting to look at; Just a test home project;

Printing description of printableRect (LEITZ):
(CGRect) printableRect = origin=(x=9.52440929, y=3.5999999) size=(width=230.399994, height=998.787414)
continuous 91mm (91mm = width=230.399994 + x=9.52440929 == 960dots) k = 1:4.16666666666667
seems 4.16666666666667 is a really magic number; need to play with in;
